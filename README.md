## TODO

Todo can be found in the [TODO.md](TODO.md) file.

## Building

This project requires (at the moment) the "PROD_FLAG" to be set to "true" in the ".env" file. This will essentially clone the dependencies from github and manually build them. Turning this off will make this NOT build!

## Config

The configs for teleop/auto/other can be found in the /config/ folder. Please read the [documentation](https://github.com/lolhol/KeybindConfigurator) of KeybindConfigurator for more information. All the initiation code is found in the /initiate/ folder (inside src).
